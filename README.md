## About Website

User has an option to pick three different pictures twenty-five times. Everytime a user clicks an image three new images will be generated and displayed on the website. After the user has exceeded the number of trials, which is 25 in this case, he/she will have an option of viewing the results, which shows the number of times an image has been shown and the number of times it has been clicked. Also, a chart is provided that graphs the relevant information. The website stores the data so when the user refreshes the page, data generated in the previous run is still available, unless the user selects the option to clear all data, which deletes the local storage and completely resets everything.
